# twitterPOV
Just a quick script to look at twitter through someone else's Point-of-view.

For example, if you like Elon Musk, the script will grab everyone he follows and build a private twitter list with everyone he follows. You can then use any off-the-shelf twitter client (that supports lists) to pull up the list and see the exact same twitter stream as Elon Musk would see.

Some caveats: Twitter limits lists to 500 users or less so if your celebrity crush follows a ton of people, this solution won't work.

This script has a dependency on the https://github.com/bear/python-twitter

Also must set up your https://dev.twitter.com/ account so you can get your API credentials.
